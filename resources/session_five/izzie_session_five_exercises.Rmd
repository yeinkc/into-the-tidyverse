**Note:** This exercise sheet is much shorter than the rest to allow more time in preparation for the DataViz Battle. If you feel like you need more practice with these topics, please have a look at the last part of chapter 3 from [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).

Remember, before you can use the tidyverse, you need to load the package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Missing Pieces

### R Scripts

1. Create an R Script that will produce a histogram of the city mileages in the `mpg` dataset
2. Run this script
3. Why is it important to include library imports at the start of our R scripts?
4. Create an R Script containing a pipeline that takes the `diamonds` dataset, groups by `color`, and summarises the mean of each group
5. Leave a blank line and then add code to create a bar chart of the classes in `mpg`
6. Place your cursor on the first line of the script. What happens when you use `ctrl-enter`? What code is executed? Where does your cursor move to?


## Advanced Data Visualisation

### Statistical Transformations

1. In our proportional bar chart we had to write `group = -1`. Why was that needed and what would happen without it?

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = -1))
```

2. What are the default stats for `geom_line()`, `geom_histogram()`, and `geom_density()`?

3. What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control its behaviour?

### Positional Adjustments

1. Create a jitter plot both by using `geom_point()` with `position = "jitter"` and `geom_jitter() with the diamonds dataset

2. What parameters can be used to control the behaviour of `geom_jitter()`? Instead of using `position = "jitter"`, use `position = position_jitter(...)` and confirm that you can pass in these same parameters

3. Compare and contrast the use of `geom_jitter()` and `geom_count()` in plotting `hwy` against `cty` with the `mpg` dataset

### Coordinate Systems

1. Create a bar plot of the cylinder numbers in the `mpg` dataset and convert it into a Coxcomb plot using `coord_polar()`

2. What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mileage in the `mpg` dataset? Why is `coord_fixed()` important and what does `geom_abline()` do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

### Theming

1. Create a plot of your choice and use the `theme()` function to make the gridlines green

2. How can we use theming to improve the look of the pie chart we generated earlier?


### Further Research

1. Look at the latest ggplot cheatsheet [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf). What geometries have we not mentioned? 

2. Read the section titled 'Statistical transformations' from Chapter 3 of [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html). This goes into more detail regarding the interplay between stats and geometries. Try creating a bar chart using `stat_count()`

3. Look at the help page for `coord_cartesian()`. How can we use this to zoom in on our plot

4. Read [this](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-axis-scales-and-transformations) guide on axis scale and transformations in ggplot. In particular, have a look at the `scale_*_date()` family of functions

5. Read [this](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labeller.html) page of the ggplot documentation, showing how to setup custom facet labels
