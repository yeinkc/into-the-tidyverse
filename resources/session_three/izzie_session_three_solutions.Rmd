```{r global_options,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message = FALSE)
```

As always, we start by loading the tidyverse package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Back to the Basics

### Arithmetic with Boolean Values

#### Part 1

```{r}
5 + TRUE
```

Under-the-hood, `TRUE` is stored as `1`, and so when we use `TRUE` in an arithmetic operation, it gets converted to this numeric form.

#### Part 2

Likewise `FALSE` is stored as `0` so `5 + FALSE` is `5`.

#### Part 3

Since `TRUE` represents `1` and `FALSE` represents `0`, the sum of a logical vector will return the number of `TRUE` values.

#### Part 4

Similar to before, but `mean()` will give the proportion of true values.

#### Part 5

`FALSE < TRUE` is the same as `0 < 1` which is clearly true. This means that `FALSE` values will be sorted before `TRUE` values by default when we use `arrange()`.

## The dpylr verbs

### Filter

#### Part 1

```{r}
filter(diamonds, price == max(price))
```

The highest price is $18,823 (currency obtained from `?diamonds`) and the carat of this diamond is 2.29.

#### Part 2

```{r}
mpg_grpd <- group_by(mpg, year)
filter(mpg_grpd, displ == min(displ))
```

There are actually multiple cars sharing the minimum engine size for each year although they are all of the same make and model.

Note that we could have used a pipe (`%>%`) instead of creating `mpg_grpd`.

#### Part 3

```{r}
filter(iris, Petal.Length > 6.4 | Petal.Width > 2.4)
```

### Arrange

#### Part 1

We actually don't need to print the tables. The function `glimpse()` will give us these types.

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)
```

`class` is a character variable and so this column will be ordered alphabetically. Meanwhile, `cut` is an ordinal (ordered) variable and so will be ordered in the same way as the undersying order assigned to the column.

#### Part 2

```{r}
arrange(mpg, hwy - cty)
```

### Select

#### Part 1

```{r}
select(diamonds, -price)
```

#### Part 2

Select the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 11th column of the `mpg` dataset.

### Mutate

#### Part 1

N/A

#### Part 2

```{r}
mutate(mpg, trans = factor(trans))
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
mutate(mpg, is_automatic = trans == 'auto(l5)')
```

#### Part 4

```{r}
mpg_grpd <- group_by(mpg, class)
mutate(mpg_grpd, best_in_class = hwy == max(hwy))
```

#### Part 5

```{r}
mutate(diamonds, expensive = price > quantile(price)[3])
```

### Summarise

#### Part 1

```{r}
summarise(iris,
          Petal.Length.Median = median(Petal.Length),
          Petal.Width.Median = median(Petal.Width),
          Sepal.Length.Median = median(Sepal.Length),
          Sepal.Width.Median = median(Sepal.Width))
```

There is actually an easier way to do this using `summarise_at()` though this set of functions can be quite difficult to get your head around.

#### Part 2

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(min(price))
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(MeanOzone = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Part 4

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut, color) %>%
  summarise(range = diff(range(carat)))
```

### Pipelines

#### Part 1

```{r}
mpg %>%
  filter(class != '2-seater') %>%
  mutate(efficiency = (cty + hwy) / 2) %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(max_efficiency = max(efficiency)) %>%
  arrange(desc(max_efficiency))
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
iris %>%
  mutate(Petal.Area = Petal.Width * Petal.Length,
         Sepal.Area = Sepal.Width * Sepal.Length) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Petal.Area, y = Sepal.Area, col = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

#### Part 3

N/A

## Going Beyond

### Ranking

#### Part 1

Done.

#### Part 2

A dense rank makes the most sense here since we want to select all days with the second highest for each month.

```{r}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  # low values have low rank so negate total_rainfall
  mutate(solar_rank = dense_rank(-Solar.R)) %>%
  filter(solar_rank == 2) %>%
  # optionally remove ranking column
  select(-solar_rank)
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(mileage_rank = dense_rank(cty)) %>%
  filter(mileage_rank == 1) %>%
  # we no longer need the rank column
  select(-mileage_rank)
```

### Un-grouping

#### Part 1

We recieve the error ``Error: Column `Class` can't be modified because it's a grouping variable``.

#### Part 2

The error occurs when we run the `mutate` function.

#### Part 3

The problem is that we didn't ungroup before applying the mutate. We are therefore still grouped by `Class` and `Age` which means that we are not allowed to modify either of these until we have ungrouped.
